# Deployment Guide for Pac-Makakas

## Build Process

This TypeScript application requires compilation before deployment. The build process compiles TypeScript files to JavaScript using AMD modules.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm

### Build Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project (compile TypeScript to JavaScript)
npm run build

# Start local development server
npm start

# Watch mode for development (auto-compile on changes)
npm run dev
```

## Netlify Deployment

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Netlify will automatically detect the `netlify.toml` configuration
3. Build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `.` (root directory)
   - **Node version**: 18

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. Run the build locally:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. Upload the entire project directory to Netlify, ensuring the `js/` folder with compiled JavaScript files is included.

### Important Files for Deployment

- `js/` - Compiled JavaScript files (generated by `npm run build`)
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `css/` - Stylesheets
- `img/` - Images and assets
- `snd/` - Sound files
- `lib/` - Third-party libraries
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration

### Build Output

The TypeScript compiler generates:
- JavaScript files in the `js/` directory
- Source maps (`.js.map` files) for debugging
- AMD modules compatible with RequireJS

### Troubleshooting

- If build fails, ensure TypeScript is installed: `npm install -g typescript`
- Check that all TypeScript files compile without errors
- Verify the `js/` directory is created after running `npm run build`
- Make sure Node.js version is 18 or higher in Netlify settings
